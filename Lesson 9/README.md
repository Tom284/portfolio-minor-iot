# Lesson 9

## Presentation

* During the practice round of the presentation before the actual IoT end-presentation, Ulrich mentioned to maltie and I that it would have been better if we had added a visual in the Node-red dashboard. Instead of logging values to the console. When I heard this, I instantly had to agree. But it was something we hadn't thought of the day before. But I quickly altered the presentation and made an example gauge of what a ui display in node-red would look like.

* After the real presentation we got positive feedback, which was a nice way to end this module. 



## Reflection

* The presentation went well, I am glad we managed to work with a Ph sensor like the initial plan was. I am a bit sad we didn't have more time to integrate it into our app, but we already made a cool IoT device that has different communication methods and multiple pieces of hardware so I am definitely very happy. 
I honestly enjoyed this course a lot. I learned so many new and fun things. This was a great module. Fadi said this during the reflection of the module and I 100% agree, that Ulrich is a great teacher. It was incredible to get this course from him.
