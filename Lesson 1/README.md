# Lesson 1

## About me

* The course that I am following is to become a software engineer, so I have about 3+ years of programming experience. Mainly with C# and Java.
* I have done a little bit with Arduino but that was at the start of my course. And I didn’t make a lot with hardware back then, it was just working a little bit with a led. 
* I own a Raspberry Pi 4 but I mainly use it as a way to host applications. So I have a little bit of experience with Linux, but not a lot.
* I don’t know any makers except for the teacher of this course, but I would really like to learn about this. Me and a friend of mine have talked about making our own remote controlled car and I feel like this would be the first step in being able to do that. It seems like this class teaches the basics/fundamentals of what a maker can do.
* I was at the introduction lesson at the start of this minor and there we talked a bit about IoT. So I know the absolute basics. 
* I expect to make some fun IoT projects that will teach me the solid basics about working with hardware.
