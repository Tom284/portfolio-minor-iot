# Lesson 1

## About me

* The course that I am following is to become a software engineer, so I have about 3+ years of programming experience. Mainly with C# and Java.
* I have done a little bit with Arduino but that was at the start of my course. And I didn’t make a lot with hardware back then, it was just working a little bit with a led. 
* I own a Raspberry Pi 4 but I mainly use it as a way to host applications. So I have a little bit of experience with Linux, but not a lot.
* I don’t know any makers except for the teacher of this course, but I would really like to learn about this. Me and a friend of mine have talked about making our own remote controlled car and I feel like this would be the first step in being able to do that. It seems like this class teaches the basics/fundamentals of what a maker can do.
* I was at the introduction lesson at the start of this minor and there we talked a bit about IoT. So I know the absolute basics. 
* I expect to make some fun IoT projects that will teach me the solid basics about working with hardware.

## What is IoT

* The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.
* IoT domains: Healthcare, Transport & logistics, Retail, Insurance, Banking, Cities, Space
* IoT protocols: Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport Protocol (MQTT)
* IoT devices: Smart lock, Google home, Nest Smoke Alarm, Philips Hue Bulbs and Lighting System, Smart watches, Smart bicycles
* IoT benefits: It automates tasks that one normally would have needed to do themselves, it can save money, it can increase productivity, it is easy to access.
* IoT challenges: Lack of encryption, limited battery life, poor connection, implementing cross platform functionality.

* Why ESP8266: It’s the bridge between software and hardware and it is cheap.
* Personal inspiration: I would eventually like to be able to make a remote controlled car.
* What is the connection to coffee: A specific version of the hardware is called the espresso lite.

## Story
**Middle school emergency remote for schools in The Netherlands:**
* Person getting robbed: Jan, Robber: Kees, School emergency respondents: Gert, Henk
* Jan goes to school in Maastricht, which is the capital of one of the provinces in The Netherlands. Recently there have been some emergencies with people getting robbed under knife point. Often people lose their cash, their phone, their jewellery and other valuables. To counter this problem the school has given everyone a small remote which they can attach to their backpacks, the school also gave a warning that the students should only press the button on the remote in case of an emergency. 
Jan’s classes have finished and he started packing his bag. He checked if the remote was still on his backpack and when he saw that it was, he turns it on. 
Kees knows that classes are about to end and he goes and stand in an alleyway, knowing that at some point a student will walk past him. 
Jan messages his parents that he is about to walk home and that his phone is almost empty as he was playing on it a lot during lunch break. 
Jan then starts walking home. 
Kees sees a student, so he quickly looks around before pulling Jan into the alley. 
Jan is really shocked by this and also a little scared.
Kees asks for all of the valuables that Jan has.
Jan shows Kees his phone and then does as he is supposed to do, he presses the alarm button on his backpack. 
Suddenly an alarm sound can be heard.
This scares Kees who quickly grabs Jan’s phone and makes a run for it. 
Henk is looking at the monitoring screen when suddenly an alarm sound can be heard. He checks the origin of the alarm and tells Gert to head to the direction.
A couple of minutes later Gert arrives at Jan’s location and he starts calming Jan down.
Gert then brings Jan home and together they explain what happened to Jan’s parents.
Jan’s parents then call the police and file an insurance report. 

### Feedback
The functionalities are listed are cool, It was a different angle from what the others have done. 
After having seen the one Johanna had made, I got recommended to add timestamps as that really fits a security scenario.


## Reflection

* I managed to arrange to get all of the hardware in The Netherlands in relatively short time, I figured out what I would have to do for the next lesson on Wednesday. And after that I started working on the things I had to do. Watching the lectures back went well, the recordings worked great and I think I was able to do all of the exercises that the others did. Making the scenario was similar to making a user story which is something I regularly have to do during my school semesters, the difference was that this story has to be more pitch able so I had to add more details. 
I am very excited to actually start working with hardware and to start programming as that is the part I know I will really enjoy.
