# Lesson 1

## About me

* The course that I am following is to become a software engineer, so I have about 3+ years of programming experience. Mainly with C# and Java.
* I have done a little bit with Arduino but that was at the start of my course. And I didn’t make a lot with hardware back then, it was just working a little bit with a led. 
* I own a Raspberry Pi 4 but I mainly use it as a way to host applications. So I have a little bit of experience with Linux, but not a lot.
* I don’t know any makers except for the teacher of this course, but I would really like to learn about this. Me and a friend of mine have talked about making our own remote controlled car and I feel like this would be the first step in being able to do that. It seems like this class teaches the basics/fundamentals of what a maker can do.
* I was at the introduction lesson at the start of this minor and there we talked a bit about IoT. So I know the absolute basics. 
* I expect to make some fun IoT projects that will teach me the solid basics about working with hardware.

## What is IoT

* The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.
* IoT domains: Healthcare, Transport & logistics, Retail, Insurance, Banking, Cities, Space
* IoT protocols: Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport Protocol (MQTT)
* IoT devices: Smart lock, Google home, Nest Smoke Alarm, Philips Hue Bulbs and Lighting System, Smart watches, Smart bicycles
* IoT benefits: It automates tasks that one normally would have needed to do themselves, it can save money, it can increase productivity, it is easy to access.
* IoT challenges: Lack of encryption, limited battery life, poor connection, implementing cross platform functionality.

* Why ESP8266: It’s the bridge between software and hardware and it is cheap.
* Personal inspiration: I would eventually like to be able to make a remote controlled car.
* What is the connection to coffee: A specific version of the hardware is called the espresso lite.
