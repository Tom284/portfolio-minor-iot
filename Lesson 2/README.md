# Lesson 2

## Definitions I had found

* Internet: a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.
* Server: a computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network.
* Cloud computing : the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.
* Edge computing: Edge computing is a distributed information technology (IT) architecture in which client data is processed at the periphery of the network, as close to the originating source as possible.
* Fog computing: Fog computing is a type of network architecture (i.e., how the systems are connected within a network and to the Internet) that links cloud computing (storage of data and programs over the Internet) to the Internet of Things (IoT). It allows data transmitted between IoT devices and cloud services to be processed faster because it brings them closer to one another.
* Swarm: Swarm lets you remotely send commands to IoT devices in reaction to changing conditions.
* Things: Objects
* Gateway: An IoT Gateway is a solution for enabling IoT communication, usually device -to-device communications or device-to-cloud communications.
* Nodes: Nodes can be any device, server or database which can add value to the communication between machines based on which decisions can be made.

Some of the definitions that I had found weren't really coorect. Mainly the swarm one was more of edge case from what was actually meant.

## ESP8266
* My version is the NodeMCU ESP Wifi
* I made it blink using the basic example without having to alter the code.
