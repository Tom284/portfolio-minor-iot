# Lesson 3

## Altering light over wifi
* During this lesson I made a remote lightswitch. To switch the light over wifi, I used the previous code. But I also made some new code which can be found in button_press. I struggled a bit with only executing the code if the button ahs been pressed, but this was at first because the hardware wires weren't said up properly. Which I figured out by taking a good look at my breadboard. After that the same thing kind of happend but it was because the power of the button is inverted. So if the button says it is HIGH it is actually LOW. I also struggled a bit with deciding how I should alter what happens between button presses. I ended up with counting everytime a button has been pressed, and depending on if the press count is even or not, I switch the status of the light. So now I can turn the light on with a button press and off with a button press.
