# Lesson 5

## Exercises

### Temperature

* I managed to send the temperature my ESP with am2320 gets over the mqtt broker to node-red. (The code is in the mqtt_esp8266_basic_send folder.)

### Remote mqtt LED

* Because I didn't have a working relay, I was allowed to use mqtt to turn a LED on and off. Since the goal of the exercise was to learn about mqtt. I added a switch on the UI so I could use that to turn the light on and off. (The code is in the mqtt_esp8266_led folder.)

### ESP8266 LED switch based on temperature

* In this exercise I can switch the LED status based on the temperatre the am2320 measures. I have it all in one system as I thought that's what I had to do. (The code is in the mqtt_esp8266_led_and_temperature folder.)
